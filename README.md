# In Situ Sequencing Decoding with Starfish on Google Colab

## Features

- Perform decoding of In Situ Sequencing data using Starfish.
- Utilize the computational resources of Google Colab for efficient processing.
- Run ISS decoding workflows easily without the need for complex local setup.

## Prerequisites

Before using this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Access to a Google account to use Google Colab.

## Getting Started

To get started with In Situ Sequencing decoding using Starfish on Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. Open the [In Situ Sequencing Decoding Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/wahlby-lab/ISS_Decoding_colab/blob/main/ISS_decoding.ipynb) in Google Colab.
2. Sign in to your Google account if prompted.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to run the cells sequentially.
4. Customize the decoding parameters and workflow according to your specific ISS dataset.
5. Monitor the progress and review the results generated by the decoding pipeline.
